# NiftyBAY: Decentralized NFT Platform

> A Next.js powered platform for AI-generated NFTs using Lilypad and Filecoin

A decentralized NFT minting, trading, and showcasing platform powered by Lilypad's AI capabilities and Filecoin's decentralized storage. Think of it as social media for NFTs, where users can flaunt, trade, and showcase their collections with ease.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered NFT Creation** - Generate unique NFT collections with text prompts using LLaMA 3 and Stable Diffusion
- **Decentralized Storage** - Store all NFTs and metadata on IPFS and Filecoin
- **On-Chain Ownership** - Secure minting through Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)
- **Social Engagement** - Follow creators, like collections, and engage with the NFT community
- **Web3 Integration** - Connect with popular Web3 wallets
- **Intuitive UI** - Pixel art themed interface that's easy to navigate
- **Trade NFTs** - Buy, sell, and trade NFTs directly on the platform
- **Collection Management** - Create and manage multiple NFT collections


### How It Works

1. **NFT Creation with Lilypad**
   - User submits a collection idea through our platform
   - LLaMA 3, running on Lilypad, generates creative prompts for the collection
   - LLaMA 3 also decides which image generation model best suits each prompt
   - The selected model (usually a Stable Diffusion variant) generates the NFT artwork
   - All orchestration between text and image models happens entirely on Lilypad

2. **Decentralized Storage with Filecoin**
   - Generated NFT artwork and metadata are uploaded to IPFS
   - Content is stored in a decentralized manner for long-term persistence
   - NFTs are minted using Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)
   - This ensures secure, on-chain ownership and metadata persistence

3. **Social Platform Features**
   - Users can showcase their NFT collections
   - Community members can follow creators, like collections, and engage with others
   - NFT owners can trade their creations directly on the platform
